# Tests for Quantum MASALA

Presently, only system-level tests are available. These tests are written in Python and can be run using the `pytest` framework. To run the tests, first install the `pytest` package using `pip`:

```bash
python -m pip install -U pytest
```

Then, navigate to the `tests` directory and run the tests using the following command:

```bash
pytest -vra .
```

The tests should take roughly a minute to run.
